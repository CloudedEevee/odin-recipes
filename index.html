    <h1> Odin Recipes </h1> 
        <p> Finding good recipes can be difficult,
            but keeping track of them is even harder.
            That's why I've decided to compile a list 
            of cookie recipes - ordering from most 
            interesting to least interesting - I would 
            be willing to try.

            Of course, we can't forget the <a href="./recipes/ccc.html"> classic cookie</a>!
