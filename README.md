# odin-recipes

My first test project!

Goal: To create a web page with a main index page which has multiple links to recipes. 


Reflection: I can now add lists fairly easily, <strong> and <em> are simple concepts for me now. Headings are simple as well. 




Reflection 2: I am now better at linking different pages within the website I'm making, I am better at understanding where I am within my directories, and I am better at creating the html boilerplate. I am very proud of myself.
