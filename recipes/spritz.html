            Growing up, my grandmother and I would bake 
            nearly every time I visited her. Around christmas
            time, she would pull out her vintage spritz press
            and help me put together the most delicious cookies.

        <p class="flavor">
            As time passed and I grew, I learned to make these 
            cookies on my own. I put my own spin on it. This 
            recipe is just as good to start with!

                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F

                <li>In a medium bowl, cream together 
                    butter and cream cheese. Add sugar

                    peaks and on the bottoms. Remove
