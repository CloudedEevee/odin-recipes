        <em>Oatmeal raisin cookies hold a 
        special place in my heart.</em>
    </h4>

        Even when cheaply made, they are 
        still delicious. But why have 
        store-bought, when you could make them
        so much better at home?
    </p>
    <p class="flavor">
        Simplicity is the game with this. 
        Start by mixing the wet ingredients together.
        In a separate bowl, mix everything but the 
        rolled oats and raisins. Mix the two
        bowls together, and then incorporate 
        the oats and raisins.
    </p> 
    <p class="flavor">
        From there, all you need to do is 
        scoop a spoonful of the batter into 
        dollops on your cookie sheet and 
        bake!

                Preheat the oven to 375 
                degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Line two cookie sheets with 
                parchment paper or silicone liners.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Beat butter, white sugar, and brown 
                sugar in a large bowl until smooth 
                and creamy. Beat in eggs and vanilla 
                until fluffy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir together flour, baking soda, 
                cinnamon, and salt. Gradually beat 
                into the butter mixture. Stir in 
                oats and raisins. Drop teaspoonfuls 
                of batter onto the prepared cookie 
                sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until 
                golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes, 
                switching racks halfway through. 
                Remove from the oven and let sit 
                on the cookie sheets for 1 to 2 
                minutes before transferring cookies 
                to a wire rack to cool completely.
